        Executes the "An Improved Envy-Free Cake Cutting Protocol for Four Agents" to allocate
        a cake to 4 agents.

        Runs the main protocol of the algorithm, which is divided into 3 phases.

        PHASE1
        Run `core` 4 times with the first agent (agent1) as the cutter.
        If for all those runs, the same agent was allocated their insignificant slice, `correction`
        is ran on the allocation where each agent gained the least.

        `core` is ran again with the first agent as the cutter.
        If cutter is the most satisfied agent, run the `Selfridge-Conway` protocol on the remaining slices for
        agents 2, 3, 4 (not the cutter), and return the result.
        Otherwise, define agent E as the most satisfied agent, run `core` with E as the cutter, excluding agent1
        from the competition phase of `core`.

        PHASE2
        define A as the least satisfied agent, and the other agents as B, C and D in order.
        Run `core` twice with D as the cutter, excluding the more satisfied out of B or C from the competition
        phase.

        If B and C are not both less satisfied then A and D, define F as on of B,C who received their
        insignificant slice in the last 2 runs `core`, and run `correction` on the allocation where
        the gain of F is smallest.

        PHASE3
        Run `cut_and_choose` on the cake remainder for B and C.

        """
        Runs the core protocol of "An Improved Envy-Free Cake Cutting Protocol for Four Agents".

        Starts by having `cutter` cut the residue into 4 slices which they view as equal in value.
        The preferences of the other agents are then explored. Agents whose first preference is not
        conflicted with other agents receive their favorite slice.

        If all the agents received their favorite slice, return. Otherwise, we start the competition phase.

        For each of the non-cutter agents, we compare preferences.
        Agent who:
            - has not competition on the second preference, or
            - has 1 competition on the second preference, the competing agent also considers the slice as their second
            preference, and both have 1 competition for their first preference

        will make a "2-mark" on the first preference, which is a mark that makes the left part of the slice
        equal in value to the second preference.
        Other agents make a "3-mark" on the second preference, which is a mark that markes the left part of that
        preference equal in value to the third preference.

        Now allocate the slices by the rightmost rule:

        Find an agent which has made the rightmost mark on 2 slices. If one was found,
        out of those 2 slices, cut them until the second rightmost mark on each slice. Said
        agent will receive the preferred out of the two slices. The other slice is given to the
        agent who made the second rightmost mark on the slice taken by the previous agent.

        If there is no agent with rightmost marks on 2 slices, all the slices with marks are
        cut until the second rightmost mark, and each is allocated to the agent who made the rightmost mark.

        If any non-cutters remain that did not receive any slice yet, they are each given their preferred
        slice, out of the remaining uncut slices, in arbitrary order.

        Now the cutter is given the last unallocated complete slice, and the allocation
        of slices is returned.
