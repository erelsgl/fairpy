    """
    An algorithm for proportional cake division, with unequal shares. Best known complexity! 2(n-1)*celling(log2(D)), where D is the value of the whole cake.
    All agents must value the cake with the same value D, which is the sum of their demands.
    n<D, meaning value of the whole cake must be greater then the number of agents.

    :param agents: the list of all n agents in the original protocol.
    :param agents_demands: dictionary of agents and their demands.
    :param allocation: the current allocation (will be updated during the run).
    :param start: the leftmost end of the cake that should be allocated.
    :param end: the rightmost end of the cake that should be allocated.
    :return: nothing - the allocation is modified in place.

    *Simple example - 2 agents with same demands and value functions
    >>> from fairpy.agents import PiecewiseConstantAgent
    >>> Alice = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,1], "Alice")
    >>> Bob = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,1], "Bob")
    >>> _agents_demands = {"Alice":1, "Bob":1}
    >>> proportional_division_with_unequal_shares([Alice, Bob], _agents_demands, 0, 1) # doctest: +SKIP
    Alice gets {(0, 0.5)} with value 1.
    Bob gets {(0.5, 1)} with value 1.
    <BLANKLINE>

    *the next example the one for each time the player to the left is put there alone. The one with demands 6,3,3.
    *For this doctest I went ahead and complicated it a little more, to make it interesting :) .
    >>> Alice = PiecewiseConstantAgent([6,4,2], "Alice")
    >>> Bob = PiecewiseConstantAgent([4,4,4], "Bob")
    >>> Cat = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,8,3], "Cat")
    >>> _agents_demands = {"Alice":6, "Bob":3, "Cat":3}
    >>> proportional_division_with_unequal_shares([Alice, Bob, Cat], _agents_demands, 0, 1) # doctest: +SKIP
    Alice gets {(0, 0.3)} with value 6.
    Bob gets {(0.53, 1)} with value 5.64.
    Cat gets {(0.3, 0.53)} with value 3.
    <BLANKLINE>

    *Example showing "edge case", as suggested - opposite values
    >>> Alice = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,1,2,2,2,1], "Alice")
    >>> Bob = PiecewiseConstantAgent([2,2,1,1,1,2], "Bob")
    >>> _agents_demands = {"Alice":5, "Bob":4}
    >>> proportional_division_with_unequal_shares([Alice, Bob], _agents_demands, 0, 1) # doctest: +SKIP
    Alice gets {(0.333, 1)} with value 7.
    Bob gets {(0,0.333)} with value 4.
    <BLANKLINE>

    *Example showing bound is tight - each player gets at least his demand
    >>> Alice = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,1,1,1], "Alice")
    >>> Bob = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,1,1,1], "Bob")
    >>> Cat = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,1,1,1], "Cat")
    >>> Dug = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,1,1,1], "Dug")
    >>> _agents_demands = {"Alice":1, "Bob":1, "Cat":1, "Dug":1}
    >>> proportional_division_with_unequal_shares([Alice, Bob, Cat, Dug], _agents_demands, 0, 1) # doctest: +SKIP
    Alice gets {(0.0, 0.25)} with value 1.
    Bob gets {(0.25,0.5)} with value 1.
    Cat gets {(0.5,0.75)} with value 1.
    Dug gets {(0.75,1)} with value 1.
    <BLANKLINE>

    *Example for which the algorithm DOESN'T work - player with deamnd -1, as all deamnds should be positive integers
    >>> Alice = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,2,0], "Alice")
    >>> Bob = PiecewiseConstantAgent([1,1,1], "Bob")
    >>> Cat = PiecewiseConstantAgent([0.3,0.4,2.3], "Cat")
    >>> _agents_demands = {"Alice":-1, "Bob":1, "Cat":2}
    >>> proportional_division_with_unequal_shares([Alice, Bob, Cat], _agents_demands, 0, 1) # doctest: +SKIP
    Alice gets ??? - stuck!
    Bob gets 0 - see detailed explanation in documentaion (phase b, writing exapmles)
    Cat gets {(0,1)} with value 3
