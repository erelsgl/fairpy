"""
important note:
these algorithms are susceptible to python floating point math errors.
In Python, for instance, 0.1+0.2>0.3. This creates a situation where, for instance,
a cut that should be envy free is not seen as one to calculation errors when
creating it.

Therefore, both algorithms use a paramater called roundAcc to round values
in order to prevent fragmentation caused due to these errors. Furthermore,
it is recommended that when using these algorithms the cake will be in a large
size, in order to prevent calculation errors as much as possible.
